<h1 class="font-bold">Hi I'm <a class="hover:text-blue-500 border-blue-500 cursor-pointer"  class="hover:text-blue-500 border-blue-500 cursor-pointer"  class="hover:text-blue-500 border-blue-500 cursor-pointer"  href="https://www.twitter.com/jordanmorgan10" target="_blank">Jordan...</a></h1>
and it's really nice to meet you! I'm here to help you with **indie development** and **writing fine code on any Apple platform**. 

I love indie life, and my most <a class="hover:text-blue-500 border-blue-500 cursor-pointer"  class="hover:text-blue-500 border-blue-500 cursor-pointer"  class="hover:text-blue-500 border-blue-500 cursor-pointer"  href="/a-new-home-for-spend-stack.html">recent app was acquired</a>. Now, I'm spending some time to write down all that I've learned over the years to share it with people like you.

More than anything, I dig developing **tightly focused apps** on iOS. I'm slightly obsessed with going a bit further, so each year I read Apple's Human Interface Guidlines from top to bottom and keep a helpful list on how to apply those tips here.

My close second love is **writing and teaching**. I do both of those right where you're at now, so thanks for coming! I'm currently working on a new book and developing courses.
