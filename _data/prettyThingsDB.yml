    description: Castro explaining its premium features.
    works: This just makes you want it. I had no intention of ever subscribing to Castro\'s premium plan, but after seeing the playful and informative way they described all of the benefits, I certainly considered it. These screens tend to be so boring, this one isn\'t.

  - title: App Group Grid
    description: The app grid shown when tapping an app group.
    works: Apple\'s mastery of depth shines through here. The background has a nice spring animation to introduce the blur which helps put the focus on the app grid that animates in, shown here.

  - title: Cash App Drawer
    description: The animation when moving from preset options to numeric entry.
    works: Animations only work when they feel fluid and natural. Here, I instinctively knew to swipe up to discover more options and expected a numeric entry screen. That\'s exactly what I got.

  - title: Honk Settings
    description: The setting screen in the Honk messaging app.
    works: One thing people typically miss when designing is using the app\'s voice. Honk is playful and cheery, and it\'s bubbly setting screen perfectly reflects that voice.
