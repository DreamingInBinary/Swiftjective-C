    works: Apple\'s mastery of depth shines through here. The background has a nice spring animation to introduce the blur which helps put the focus on the app grid that animates in, shown here.

  - title: Cash App Drawer
    description: The animation when moving from preset options to numeric entry.
    works: Animations only work when they feel fluid and natural. Here, I instinctively knew to swipe up to discover more options and expected a numeric entry screen. That\'s exactly what I got.

    works: One thing people typically miss when designing is using the app\'s voice. Honk is playful and cheery, and it\'s bubbly setting screen perfectly reflects that voice.
