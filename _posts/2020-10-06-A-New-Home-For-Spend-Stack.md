*Deep breath*

It's with a wide range of emotions, but the biggest one being excitement, that I've got some personal news to share:

Spend Stack has been acquired.
END TWEET COPY

Where do I even start with this one?

Spend Stack, and my LLC which sells it (Dreaming In Binary LLC), has been acquired by Prometheus Interactive, effective today.

This is a very, very good thing - especially for Spend Stack users.

Why I sold (house, opportunity cost, outgrown me, it needs a team, etc) But I would only sell to the right person.

So, if you're looking for a post about how I sold my app for a gazillion dollars to a silicon valley titan, well - sorry to dissapoint. This is about a company taking over an app to take give it the team it needs to grow, that's outgrown it's original developer.

And I am, in fact, putting my money where my mouth is quite literally. There were at least two other companies who wanted to acquire Spend Stack for _more_ than what I sold it for, but the fit was better here. The future and nourishment of Spend Stack means more to me than making a lot of money - I can't prove it anymore through my actions.

### Spend Stack Today
To most of you, Spend Stack is quite young - only releasing last July. For me, it's much different. Spend Stack has been a big part of my life longer than my oldest child, who is about to turn 7!

I started on Spend Stack right out college in 2013, and the first version (which was not a success) shipped that year. After I pulled it off the App Store, I started work and design on the version you see today - around 2015.

Put simply - Spend Stack has been what I've done for a long time. So, I don't take any decision to part with it lightly. Not at all.

When the opportunity came up from Bill (who runs Prommetheus) to possibly take it over, I listened. I already had talked to others previously about acquiring Spend Stack, but the fit wasn't right for me. Here was my criteria:

- 

So, I had no pressure on my end. Spend Stack has grown, it's selling extremely well and it has a bright future (even moreso now). Spend Stack now has the team it so rightfully deserves it.

Put another way, I have not outgrown Spend Stack - it has simply _outgrown me_.

### Quick questions

**What if they make a million dollars from it!?**<br />
This is one of the first things my sister said when I broke the news to her. My response?

_I hope they do!_

I hope Spend Stack becomes their largest property and it takes over the entire world, nothing would make me happier. 

Why?

Because I arrived at a genuine place where I gave Spend Stack all I had to give it. I feel accomplished, at peace with it - I did all I could for it. It's kinda like if you lost a championship game, but knew you gave it all you had. Except, in this scenario - nobody is losing.

**Wait, your entire LLC was sold? Why?**<br />
Ah ,iCloud. 

The fact that I use CloudKit to sync data in Spend Stack is the only reason why this happened. Spend Stack is glued to Dreaming In Binary LLC, and I can't simply transfer the app to a new owner. So, the entire LLC was absorbed. It made the acquistion a bit trickier than usual, but we navigated it fairly easily.

**Are you still going to make stuff?**<br />
1,000%, absolutely, without a doubt. As my wife Jansyn put it, "I think a piece of you would die inside if you weren't making something." and she is absolutely right.

For now, I'm going to enjoy a nice break. I plan on taking a few months off from side projects of any kind and just relax a little bit. Then, I want to dust off something I haven't been able to do since I've always been working on Spend Stack. Here are some ideas:

- Revamp my website design. Add in some tool tips.
- Write more technical blog posts, as I used to before Spend Stack shipped.
- Finally do a book over Indie Development I've worked on off and on for the last few months.

When I do get back to apps, smaller utility based apps excited me. Spend Stack is simple on the surface, but the world of finances and the way people use software geared towards it are incredibly complex and require a lot of care. Doing something a bit "simpler" sounds like a lot of fun, and I want to ship a lot of apps this time around too, whenever I get to that point.

In short, this is a new, exciting chapter for me. 

**How much did it get acquired for?**<br />
That's NDA'd ü§ê. But, I'm very happy too üòÑ.

### Final Thoughts
It's absolutely surreal to think that these very words are some of the last I'll ever type about Spend Stack on this blog. For everyone who followed along, from the bottom of my heart - thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è.


Until next time ‚úåÔ∏è.
