The nascent vocabulary of its pieces combined (sorry) with my few dalliances with reactive programming has led to a steep learning curve. Even so, I’ve replaced <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NotificationCenter</code> code with its built in Combine publisher, and I’ve enjoyed the experience quite a lot. Operators are more concise, and clarity at the point of definition is a good way to foster a readable codebase.</p>\n\n<p>And yet.</p>\n\n<p>What more am I missing with Combine? I’ve yet to author my own Publisher type, or know when the situation would call for one. I still struggle to maintain the mental model a passthrough subject affords, other than that it acts as both publisher and receiver.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, Apple pumped out a number of freshly minted Combine documentation, one of which led me to utilizing futures in place of closures and delegates. Personally, the benefit for me is that we harness Combine’s Swiss army knife operators in lieu of boilerplate code usually found within closures and delegate patterns.</p>\n\n<p>While working on <a

I also opted for a less strict importing function, and it does much less.</p>\n\n<p>Another implementation point I waffled on was how many operators to utilize. For example, the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">sink</code> above could do nothing more than apply things to a table view, allowing for the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">map</code> operator to do more of the heavy lifting. I’m not sure which I’d prefer. With Combine, there seems to be a natural tension between how much work a publisher should abstract away and then emit, versus how much of that work the subscriber should shoulder when receiving it. In a way, it speaks to the framework’s utility that engineers even have the choice to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>More than anything, this was a learning exercise. I’m not quite sure how I feel about supplying the publisher via a function call, which is then chained off of. Maybe it’s my old Objective-C “get off my lawn” ways, I’m just not sure if that’s widely accepted or not. Patterns will emerge, though, and I’m apt to take Apple at their word and sample code.</p>\n\n<p>If you’d like some weekend reading, be sure to check the aforementioned sample documentation here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/using_combine_for_your_app_s_asynchronous_code\">Using Combine for Your App’s Asynchronous Code</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/routing_notifications_to_combine_subscribers\">Routing Notifications to Combine Subscribers</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"Replacing Foundation Timers with Timer Publishers\">Replacing Foundation Timers with Timer Publishers</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/performing_key-value_observing_with_combine\">Performing Key-Value Observing with Combine</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>If there is one thing I don’t like doing - it’s nothing.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve never been good at it. While I’m miles away from the “hustle porn” ways that are unfortunately pervasive within the tech industry, I’ve always had a natural work ethic and a desire to do more. My near-anathema towards inaction, no goals being set forth or something to solve has served me well in my career.</p>\n\n<p>But right now, I just can’t. And if you can’t either, you should know that you don’t have to.</p>\n\n<p>It’s something I’ve been having to remind myself. Not even a few hours ago, I retreated to my bathroom, closed the door and buried my head in my hands. I felt defeated - it was 9:00 a.m. and <em>just couldn’t get anything started</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Typically, my work day would’ve started hours ago. But between (literally) spilled milk, a diaper change, breaking up a fight over a kickball, making another bowl of cereal because a sibling got jealous his brother had one and he didn’t while also getting myself dressed and somewhat fed - I found no ounce of down time.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"detour\">Detour</h3>\n\n<p>When I look at my goals for the year, they stick out like a sore thumb and, now, produce a stark juxtaposition of priorities and unrealistic expectations when faced with the current world wide pandemic. I’m dutifully staying home, as I’m sure most of you are, and within these walls are my entire life:</p>\n\n<p>My wife, Bennett (age 6), Remy (age 3) and Baylor (1 year old).</p>\n\n<p>Our days are spent almost entirely spent in our 1100 square foot home with three bedrooms. In many ways, I feel thankful and lucky to have this extra time with the people I care most about it.</p>\n\n<p>But when it comes to work, and getting things done - I nearly can’t. And it bothers me, but I’ve come to accept that this is simply where things are at. Even more so, it’s the definition of “out of my control”. Either Remy is banging on my bedroom door screaming because he doesn’t understand why I can’t come out to play, or Bennett wants help with school work or Baylor wants me to hold her - I’ve come to realize that parenthood doesn’t give you a pass just because the world is on fire.</p>\n\n<p>So, I’m doing the best that I can. And some days, it’s nearly nothing. On those days, I continually count my blessings to offset my mood. I work for an amazing company and team who truly are sympathetic to not only my situation, but everyone across the team. They’ve got my back, and I’m truly grateful for it. My wife, who does this every day (pandemic or not) keeps us all together and chugging along.</p>\n\n<p>And, in between these moments, I find time to write code. And someday (who knows when) I’ll have time to write more of it.</p>\n\n<p>But right now, Xcode is getting a breather more often than not. And while it does, I’m going to take my own deep breath, be a great Dad and husband - and give my employer all I can, when I can. Some days that’s not a lot, some days it’s a little bit more than yesterday and very rarely it’s quite a bit.</p>\n\n<p>So if your productivity is  taking a hit, and you’re a little stressed about it - please know that there are many of us feeling that burn along with you. Spend Stack can wait, blog posts can wait, learning new things can wait - it all can wait. Your employer will hopefully know that some work will have to wait, too. But taking care of myself, my kids and wife cannot.</p>\n\n<p>This is nothing that Twitter hasn’t already said, but maybe you needed a reminder today. We will put COVID-19 in our rear view mirror someday. Humanity has defeated several forms of sickness before, and we will do it again. But this is not normal, and your throughput won’t be normal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>Just a take a breather, know that better days are on the way and please remember; it’s OK to do nothing. Right now, some days it’s all you can do.</p>\n\n<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Through luck, determination and whatever other stereotypical noble quality you can conjure up, Apple selected <a href=\"https://www.spendstack.com\">Spend Stack</a> to take part in their retail demo program.</p>\n\n<p>Yay! Right!? Just look at it!</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/demoStore.jpeg\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/demoStore.jpeg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Well, yes. Of course yes!</p>\n\n<p>But, if you hit the Googles for past experiences with this, you’ll find quite a lot of tumbleweeds. This makes sense, because if you happen to scan the apps that are on retail iPhones and iPads at your local Best Buy, Apple Store, etc. - they tend to be apps that hail from Big Corp©. And rightfully so, they all are quality, well made apps with the team and budget to match.</p>\n\n<p>Though, the everyman doesn’t often appear there. And if they do, it typically tends to be in the form of a game. So today, I figured I’d spend this indie dev diary chronicling my experience with getting Spend Stack on iPhones and iPads across America 🇺🇸. Think of it as Spend Stack’s official road tour 🚌.</p>\n\n<p>Or, maybe more than America. I’m not really sure? I’ll get into that later, as we’ll see.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-reach-out\">The Reach Out</h3>\n<p>During some Saturday in December when I was hacking away at Spend Stack at local coffee shop, I noticed an email that stuck out. Its subject line spoke about an incredible marketing opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>I thought it was spam 😅!</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, I took a closer look and saw the sender had a bonafide Apple domain. The message was simple enough. Someone from developer relations introduced themselves and laid out how the process works.</p>\n\n<p>From there, you just dive into the ~15 page .pdf file they give you to point out the finer details. I will say, this guide was incredibly helpful. It had step-by-step pictures with call out glyphs to ensure you were getting logistical things done correctly (especially helpful when you get into the upload part of the process).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-prep\">The Prep</h3>\n<p>With my requirements in hand, I got to work! Luckily, this occurred over my Christmas break, where I am fortunate enough to take about three weeks off each year. I had quite a large update to Spend Stack planned for this time (which I’m in the middle of now) but the opportunity cost was worth the trade.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve spent any number of minutes with these demo apps at stores, you kind of know what to expect. A splash screen saying that’s it a demo, pre-populated data and some features that are either taken out or gated by an alert controller saying it’s unavailable.</p>\n\n<p>In Spend Stack, all of this was easy enough. Instead of going through my designs and taking things out, I opted to keep them in so users would be aware they existed. I’d rather they hit a “You can’t do this in the demo” alert than be none-the-wiser to some pretty great features that are core to Spend Stack (i.e. iCloud sharing and collaborating for lists).</p>\n\n<p>The splash screen was quick to whip up - I originally was using the one I have shipped now, but it was easier to rip it out to make a more “to the point” variation:</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/compareSplash.png\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/compareSplash.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>If anything, I probably would’ve taken out the “Continue” button, as I noticed quite a few apps don’t even use one.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-problems\">The Problems</h3>\n<p>I hit some issues along the way, though. The first and most challenging was around how I chose to tackle demo data. I need quite a bit of it. I wrote a list of lists (meta!) that I wanted to include to best showcase all of the things you can do with Spend Stack. I ended up with a solid line up, and each one was filled with relevant items, images, notes and more:</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/listLists.png\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/listLists.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>The issue was, I created these all in code for my first go around. And, well - it took about 5 seconds to create the database, drop existing data and populate these on the fly. That’s a non-starter, obviously, as nobody except my Mom and (maybe) my wife would wait around for that. And even then, it would only be out of love 😅.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to turn some tricks with concurrency, but as is so often the case with programming - I stepped away from it and arrived at an answer. The epiphany came, and the solution was dead simple: simply ship the retail demo with a database. Spend Stack uses raw SQLite for data, and once I used the app and had a good set of dummy lists to work with - I simply found it within the file system on my mac and included it as part of the Xcode project.</p>\n\n<p>It booted lightning fast - done and done:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">NSString</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"n\">databaseFilePath</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">NSFileManager</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">fileManager</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"kt\">NSFileManager</span> <span class=\"n\">defaultManager</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">NSArray</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">directories</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">fileManager</span> <span class=\"kt\">URLsForDirectory</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">NSDocumentDirectory</span> <span class=\"nv\">inDomains</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">NSUserDomainMask</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">NSString</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">documentPath</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">directories</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">firstObject</span> <span class=\"kt\">URLByAppendingPathComponent</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s\">@\"spendStack.db\"</span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    \n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">documentPath</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The other hiccup has to do with multiple spaces on iPadOS. When you ship these retail apps, you’ve got to wipe any data entered on them when the user is “done” with them. Done is quite ambiguous, and there’s no concrete “when” defined. So, when a user backgrounds Spend Stack I reset everything:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"o\">-</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">void</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"nv\">sceneDidEnterBackground</span><span class=\"p\">:(</span><span class=\"kt\">UIScene</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"n\">scene</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"k\">self</span> <span class=\"n\">initateSelfDestructSequence</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The only fun thing is that when you open a new window, iOS also calls the same delegate method while the window is being setup. You can see this quite easily, and it makes sense I guess - iOS puts up that blurry view while another window slides in. So, I’ve got some jank there that I won’t share publicly to help avoid any deleterious state bugs 😅 (spoiler, it’s <em>totally</em> not a simple GCD delay, no way).</p>\n\n<p>Aside from that - uploading it App Store Connect gave me some fits. Try to hide your surprise 😜. It’s a bit of a different flow, but again - the .pdf guide they give you really helped out here.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-uncertainty\">The Uncertainty</h3>\n<p>Once it was uploaded, all that was left to do was wait. I didn’t really get much information on when and where it would be. Was this like App Store promo art, where you supply it and it might be lost to the dark ether of the App Store editorial team (still waiting for mine to be used 🤞😭🙃) or show up next week? I had no idea, so I figured I’d just point blank ask them.</p>\n\n<p>The response?</p>\n\n<p>An email telling me to gate one more feature with an alert 🤣. But, I guess that did mean they were going to use it! Shoot your shot, right?</p>\n\n<p>Getting responses was a little difficult to be honest, and in some ways frustrating, because to smaller indies like me - this is a <strong>big</strong> deal! This is getting Apple’s stamp of approval for your app! It’s marketing! Validation! The list goes on. I wanted to know I was doing everything they needed.</p>\n\n<p>Look, there could be a million reasons for why things work the way they do on the App Store and these kind of things. It could be out of certain individual’s control. It’s always easy to bemoan X or Y on the outside.</p>\n\n<p>I do know this - the rep I worked with was always kind when I chatted with them, and we cracked a few jokes back and forth. Plus, each person I’ve meet at W.W.D.C. on the App Store team was delightful, and the labs with them were a highlight. It feels like the key here is like anything else, you just need to build relationships to get things moving and I’m still working on that with the App Store folks.</p>\n\n<p>All that to say - the reason for this tweet was half because I wanted to share the news with my fellows devs, and half because I wanted to get the word out:</p>\n\n<div class=\"jekyll-twitter-plugin\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">🤩<br /><br />About that Spend Stack news...<br /><br />I’ve always said that my main goal was to make an app I’m truly proud of. While I’ve got a lot left to do, having Apple want <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpendStackApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SpendStackApp</a> on iPhones to demo their product is a huge honor for me and validation that I’m on the right track. <a href=\"https://t.co/uSGhEbv8YL\">pic.twitter.com/uSGhEbv8YL</a></p>&mdash; Jordan Morgan (@JordanMorgan10) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanMorgan10/status/1224478409423716353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 3, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div>\n\n<p>If someone saw Spend Stack at the stores, maybe they would tell me and that would be how I found out it released. Thankfully, that wasn’t necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Why? Because I straight up walked into Best Buy a few times a week to check (there’s no Apple Store by me, unfortunately). And, well - one day it was there!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-payoff\">The Payoff</h3>\n<p>There is nothing quite like walking into a brick and mortar store and seeing your own app sitting there on an iPhone. It really is one of those career moments that I’ll never forget. As someone who tends to be extremely critical of their work and a slight perfectionist, I find that being “proud” or feeling “finished” is always <em>just</em> another milestone away.</p>\n\n<p>But as my wife noted, when I walked in there and saw it - I was unmistakably proud and fulfilled. She said my face lit up, and she caught some convert, candid pics to prove it:</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/proud.jpg\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/proud.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>It was a lot of fun chatting it up with the Best Buy employees too:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Best Buy Person: Hey! Any questions about that iPhone?<br />\n Me: No, but dude - my app is on here!<br />\n Best Buy Person: Wait, what? Which one?<br />\n Me: This one!<br />\n Best Buy Person: No way! How? When? So many questions!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They all were genuinely interested, and who knows - maybe I inadvertently created the first Spend Stack sales team 😎. On our way out, my wife and I decided to take a picture to commemorate the occasion. A kind gentleman walking by offered to take it for us:</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/wifeyCakes.jpg\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/wifeyCakes.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Why is that funny? Well, we’re obviously very happy in that picture. So another couple walking by asked, with a beaming expression:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Them: Oh my goodness, did you all just get engaged!?<br />\nMe: No, but Spend Stack got selected as a retail demo on the iPhones…<br />\nThem: &lt; They cut me off, looked at me weird and walked away confused before I could finish &gt;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We still laugh about that 😜.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"other-random-insights\">Other Random Insights</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>I’ve noticed that there are about 3-4 different retail demo “line ups”.</li>\n  <li>…though some are very similar. For example, Spend Stack and Lifesum are mutually exclusive. They show up in the same spot (3rd page, 3rd row, 1st item I think) and if one is there, the other won’t be.</li>\n  <li>Most employees didn’t recall when their retail demo line up refreshed. It appears to be an over the air thing, which makes sense.</li>\n  <li>The timeline from start to finish was about two and a half months.</li>\n  <li>If it’s not already obvious from the article, you don’t apply for the retail demo - Apple proactively reaches out to you.</li>\n  <li>Sales wise it’s been a huge help, as Spend Stack tends to consistently chart since its retail demo release. Before, it tends to dip in and out throughout the month.</li>\n  <li>I go fairly in-depth on all of this, and talk about how my <a href=\"http://localhost:4000/A-Best-in-Class-App\">Best in Class</a> ideals may have helped Spend Stack get selected on an episode of <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/launched/id1491582246#episodeGuid=47cc2b57-c99a-4ced-8609-74270d651bb9\">Launched.fm</a>.</li>\n  <li>Lastly, here’s a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/f7ugww/apple_selected_my_app_spend_stack_to_be_in_its/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=i\">Reddit</a> post on <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">r/Apple</code> where I chat about it some more while answering some questions others had.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>You never know where our little creations will end up. While you toil away night after late night, it’s too easy to end up in that phase of doubt:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>“Will this even matter at all?”</li>\n  <li>“Will it get a few downloads on launch and meekly wither away?”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I’m telling you, I’ve been there. And I have a season pass too, apparently. I revisit that space probably a little too often. You start to look at other apps and their success thinking that your own are always just a day late and a dollar short.</p>\n\n<p>But hey! <strong>Sometimes you get the win!</strong> And when you do, be sure to stop and enjoy it. You never what’s around the corner, who’s paying attention to your app or when you’ll get a random email in December from Apple asking you to put your creation on thousands of iPhones with other carefully curated apps hand picked by them.</p>\n\n<p>So keep on truckin’ on that next great app 💪!</p>\n\n<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>",

I decided to follow a similar pattern as well, so I started poking around to see what other apps in the wild did for this kind of thing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-examples\">The Examples</h3>\n<p>Let’s take a quick tour of how Apple’s stock apps handle the situation:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes</strong><br />\n<img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/mdv_notes.png\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/mdv_notes.png\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Files</strong><br />\n<img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/mdv_files.png\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/mdv_files.png\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>News</strong><br />\n<img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/mdv_news.png\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/mdv_news.png\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Mail</strong><br />\n<img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/mdv_mail.png\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/mdv_mail.png\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Messages</strong><br />\n<img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/mdv_messages.png\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/mdv_messages.png\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Reminders</strong><br />\n<img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/mdv_reminders.png\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/mdv_reminders.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>I was surprised to see that quite a few of Cupertino &amp; Friends’© apps tend to use the same background color. Still, Spend Stack’s white on white in this scenario feels a little too jarring.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-implementation\">The Implementation</h3>\n<p>It turns out, this is exactly the kind of task that really eats at you on updates. It was a fleeting thought I had (to address this) and I figured it wouldn’t take more than thirty minutes. In software development, that and similar phrases are always famous last words.</p>\n\n<p>But as someone who took five years to release an app, I figured another shot of feature creep wouldn’t hurt 🤠.</p>\n\n<p>After looking at Xcode’s default master-detail view template (which has no accordances for this kind of thing), I quickly tested things out using <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">.secondaryBackground</code> for the master view - while keeping the detail view with <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">.primaryBackground</code>. This is similar to what Mail and Reminders do.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you aren’t using SwiftUI and want this process to be forty times less painless - trying using the helpful utility app <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adaptivity-a/id1054670022\">Adaptivity</a> to quickly reference colors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"o\">-</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">void</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"nv\">traitCollectionDidChange</span><span class=\"p\">:(</span><span class=\"kt\">UITraitCollection</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"n\">previousTraitCollection</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"k\">super</span> <span class=\"nv\">traitCollectionDidChange</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"n\">previousTraitCollection</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n    \n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"k\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">traitCollection</span> <span class=\"nv\">isDifferentThanTraitCollection</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"n\">previousTraitCollection</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">[[</span><span class=\"kt\">NSNotificationCenter</span> <span class=\"n\">defaultCenter</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"nv\">postNotificationName</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">SS_TRAIT_COLLECTION_CHANGED</span> <span class=\"nv\">object</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kc\">nil</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n    \n    <span class=\"kt\">UIColor</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">color</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"kt\">UIColor</span> <span class=\"n\">systemBackgroundColor</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">view</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">window</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">traitCollection</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">horizontalSizeClass</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIUserInterfaceSizeClassRegular</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">color</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"kt\">UIColor</span> <span class=\"n\">secondarySystemBackgroundColor</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n    \n    <span class=\"k\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">view</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">backgroundColor</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">color</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">tableView</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">backgroundColor</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">color</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\">// These methods do pretty much the same as above</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"k\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">toolbar</span> <span class=\"n\">updateBackgroundColor</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"k\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">navigationController</span> <span class=\"n\">updateBackgroundColor</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Which gets me half way there:</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/mdv_firstPass.png\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/mdv_firstPass.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>Not bad - but the subtleties start to creep in.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>I have to update the table view cells, easier said than done. They look okay in dark mode, but there isn’t enough contrast in light mode.</li>\n  <li>I also have to tackle both the navigation and tool bars (one of which has been busted since iOS 13, throwing me into several apoplectic fits).</li>\n  <li>And, I have to dynamically switch out styles according to trait collection changes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That last one can be a bit of a sticker. On iPadOS, you can quickly swap between a regular to compact horizontal trait collection for a number of reasons (namely, multitasking scenarios). In this case, I need to swap back and forth between the “old” style and the master view one:</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/mdv_switch.png\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/mdv_switch.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>This means my navigation, tool bars and master view all need to a get little bit smarter, more configurable or use any other of the other platter of patterns available (delegates, dependency injections, blocks or what have you). These controllers are, as you may have surmised, still written in Objective-C. Regrettably, my new favorite toy, Combine is out of the question.</p>\n\n<p>Alas, as with most of these kinds of tasks within <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIKit</code>, it’s always a hop, skip and a step away from being as simple as checking the device idiom:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-objc highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">UIColor</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">fill</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">UIColor</span> <span class=\"nf\">systemBackgroundColor</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n<span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">view</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">window</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">traitCollection</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">horizontalSizeClass</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"n\">UIUserInterfaceSizeClassRegular</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">fill</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">UIColor</span> <span class=\"nf\">secondarySystemBackgroundColor</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">UINavigationBarAppearance</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">navBarAppearance</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">UINavigationBarAppearance</span> <span class=\"nf\">new</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n<span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">navBarAppearance</span> <span class=\"nf\">configureWithOpaqueBackground</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n<span class=\"n\">navBarAppearance</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">backgroundColor</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">fill</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"n\">navBarAppearance</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">largeTitleTextAttributes</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">@{</span><span class=\"n\">NSForegroundColorAttributeName</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">UIColor</span> <span class=\"nf\">ssMainFontColor</span><span class=\"p\">]};</span>\n<span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">navigationBar</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">standardAppearance</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">navBarAppearance</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">navigationBar</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">compactAppearance</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">navBarAppearance</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">navigationBar</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">scrollEdgeAppearance</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">navBarAppearance</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">navigationBar</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">barTintColor</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">fill</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// Avoid bleed on push/pop</span>\n<span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">view</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">backgroundColor</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">navBarAppearance</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">backgroundColor</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>That gets me closer, but I either have to propagate those changes to the table cell or check in their trait collection change events as well (the latter seems to be more appropriate, though I’ve yet to get that far yet).</p>\n\n<p>There are many places where I don’t want to occur, such as modals:</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/mdv_modal.png\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/mdv_modal.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>Worse yet, my navigation and toolbars are all jank-town now. That’s to be expected (as to this point, I’ve just hardcoded a new color in) but I feel like navigation bar’s new API never quite does what I expect it to. For the life of me, I can’t quite get my navigation bar to respect my <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UINavigationBarAppearance</code> choices until it lays out its subviews.</p>\n\n<p>Here, I purposely want the navigation bar to reflect the “old” styling, yet it doesn’t update until it does another layout pass:</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/mdv_nav.gif\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/mdv_nav.gif\" /></p>\n\n<p>I use a subclassed <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UINavigationBar</code> throughout Spend Stack (same for the toolbar) and I won’t always want this behavior, so it’s not as simple as trait collection bookkeeping. For now, I’m leaning towards a simple <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">bool</code> flag to pipe right into the initializer since I style each of them there, far earlier than any trait collection change might occur.</p>\n\n<p>We’ll see what happens, and of course - I’ll have the final product in the next version of Spend Stack, version 1.2.</p>\n\n<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>In the not so distant past, it was a foregone conclusion that developers would eventually fall back to the jackhammer when it came to table or collection views: <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">reloadData</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The reasons why were simple:</p>\n\n<p>1) Getting a diff of what’s changed in your data was hard, and <br />\n2) Mapping that with the right index paths was even harder.</p>\n\n<p>But the payoff was always worth it, a buttery smooth batch reload in your interface. And hey - you can’t make an omelet without crackin’ a few eggs.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to today, and we can thankfully say that WWDC 2019 mercifully addressed both pain points. Today, let’s take a look at <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">CollectionDifference</code>, a lightweight way to calculate the once elusive diff mentioned in reason #1 above.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-little-struct-that-could\">The Little Struct That Could</h3>\n<p><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">CollectionDifference</code> arrived in Swift 5.1 by way of <a href=\"https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0240-ordered-collection-diffing.md\">SE-0240</a>. Authors Scott Perry and Kyle Macomber wanted a way to “provide an interchange format for diffs as well as diffing/patching functionality for appropriate collection types.”</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most telling part of their proposal, though, is where they state the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Representing, manufacturing, and applying transactions between states today requires writing a lot of error-prone code.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You don’t say.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, they took the problem to task and what we arrive at is <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">CollectionDifference</code> - a struct that houses insertions and removals that describe the delta between two ordered collections:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">struct</span> <span class=\"kt\">CollectionDifference</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"kt\">ChangeElement</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Perhaps the highest compliment I can extend it is that the API is easy on the eyes (uncommon for diffing libraries). As we’ll see, it’s typically a one or two line affair to get a diff and apply it, context depending.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Keep in mind this diffing capability is for <em>ordered</em> collections only. In Swift, this is any collection conforming <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/bidirectionalcollection\"><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">BidirectionalCollection</code></a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Performance-wise, the worst you can expect is O(n * m) - where <em>n</em> represents the count of the first collection, and <em>m</em> the other. You do have some influence here. If your elements conform to <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">Hashable</code> (and why the heck wouldn’t they - we got diffable data source this year which requires it) or the collection share many common elements, expect the diff to perform better.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, since Swift is an ever-mutating project, the diffing performance has <a href=\"https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25808\">already been improved</a> from its first incarnation by utilizing the <a href=\"http://www.xmailserver.org/diff2.pdf\">Myers algorithm</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"diffin\">Diffin’</h3>\n<p>As an API consumer, if one simply needs to diff something and move about their day, then there are two essential functions to know about which are invoked from the collections themselves:</p>\n\n<p><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">difference(from:)</code></p>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<p><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">applying(_)</code></p>\n\n<p>One to generate a diff (giving us a <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">CollectionDifference</code>) and one to get the result of the diff by passing it in as a parameter:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">firstDraft</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"It was the best of times...\"</span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">secondDraft</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"It was the worst of times...\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">diff</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">secondDraft</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">difference</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">from</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"n\">firstDraft</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">finalDraft</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">firstDraft</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">applying</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">diff</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">// \"It was the worst of times...\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// Or, reverse that</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">diff</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">firstDraft</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">difference</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">from</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"n\">secondDraft</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">finalDraft</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">secondDraft</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">applying</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">diff</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">// \"It was the best of times...\"</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Also note that if you need to finely tune the diff, you can also supply a closure to return a boolean based on your own equality standards:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">foo</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">bar</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">4</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">6</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">diff</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">bar</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">difference</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">from</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">foo</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"n\">oldNum</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">newNum</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">return</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">oldNum</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">newNum</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">%</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The flow is identifying what you want to compare, and then getting the results of the diff into a data structure to operate on. If that’s all you need from <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">CollectionDifference</code>, then you can hang it up and call it a day. For the curious among us, let’s look a little deeper.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"change-enum\">Change Enum</h3>\n<p>A <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">CollectionDifference</code> houses changes as represented by the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">Change</code> enum. And, since Swift’s enums are drunk with power, they house three important parts of the diff:</p>\n\n<p>1) An <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">offset</code> Int. <br />\n2) The <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">element</code> itself. <br />\n3) An optional Int, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">associatedWith</code>, that helps you track moves.</p>\n\n<p>The last one is both interesting and important. In the diff, if it moved an existing element - that’s actually a two-step dance. It’s first a removal, and then an insertion. What <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">associatedWith</code> does it track the relationship between the two. This opens up some very nice UIKit-y scenarios.</p>\n\n<p>This, however, requires a bit more work from a performance standpoint - thus the optional Int. We don’t get very many free lunches in programming, and doubly so when it comes to diffing. So, if we want the associations, we ask for them by invoking <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">inferringMoves</code>.</p>\n\n<p>For example, notice the association (represented by <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">move</code>) is nil in the following print statements:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">foo</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s\">\"A\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"B\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"D\"</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">bar</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s\">\"B\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"A\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"D\"</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">diff</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">bar</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">difference</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">from</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">foo</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">update</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">diff</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">switch</span> <span class=\"n\">update</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">remove</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">offset</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">letter</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">move</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"Removed </span><span class=\"se\">\\(</span><span class=\"n\">letter</span><span class=\"se\">)</span><span class=\"s\"> at idx </span><span class=\"se\">\\(</span><span class=\"n\">offset</span><span class=\"se\">)</span><span class=\"s\"> and moved to </span><span class=\"se\">\\(</span><span class=\"kt\">String</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">describing</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">move</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"se\">)</span><span class=\"s\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">insert</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">offset</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">letter</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">move</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"Inserted </span><span class=\"se\">\\(</span><span class=\"n\">letter</span><span class=\"se\">)</span><span class=\"s\"> at idx </span><span class=\"se\">\\(</span><span class=\"n\">offset</span><span class=\"se\">)</span><span class=\"s\"> from </span><span class=\"se\">\\(</span><span class=\"kt\">String</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">describing</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">move</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"se\">)</span><span class=\"s\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"cm\">/* Prints\nRemoved A at idx 0 and moved to nil\nInserted A at idx 1 from nil\n*/</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">baz</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">foo</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">applying</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">diff</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">// [\"Z\", \"A\", \"C\"]</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>The diff simply tells us that “A” at index 0 was removed, and “A” was inserted at index 1. But it doesn’t tell us about any potential moves, just the end result. This makes sense because we’re left with the true, and accurate, diff - so from an API perspective we shouldn’t opt in to that extra work if it’s not needed.</p>\n\n<p>If we do need it, notice how we get the associations by way of <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">inferringMoves</code>. Consider the exact code above, just with one changes in the for-loop:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">update</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">diff</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">inferringMoves</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"cm\">/* code */</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"cm\">/* Now prints\nRemoved A at idx 0 and moved to 1\nInserted A at idx 1 from 0\n*/</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Now, we can safely program against the moves.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"applications\">Applications</h3>\n<p>While playing around with diffing, I toyed with a few applications for UIKit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Batch Updates</strong><br />\nIf you’re unable to move to <a href=\"http://localhost:4000/Diffable-Datasource-Empty-View\">diffable data source</a>, or you’re just a complete glutton for pain - you can reasonably backport a diffing function with a little legwork for table and collection views. Since we know a non-nil association represents a move, we can map these over to index paths.</p>\n\n<p>For a single section table view, something like this works to produce a batch update:</p>\n\n<div

The grades below have been pulled from the Best in Class post, but some have been altered, added or left out to only include items that can be answered with a yes or no answer as it pertains to Spend Stack.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With each subsequent release, I’ll be updating my progress.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div class=\"infoContainer\">\n    <small>So far, Spend Stack is...</small>\n    <b style=\"font-size: calc(36px + 1.5vw);\">55%</b>\n    <small>...of the way towards a best in class app (48/87).</small>\n    <div class=\"centerFlex\">\n        <div class=\"smallInfoContainer\">\n            <b>Accessibility</b>\n            <small>47% (9/19)</small>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"smallInfoContainer\">\n            <b>Platform</b>\n            <small>39% (11/28)</small>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"smallInfoContainer\">\n            <b>U.X.</b>\n            <small>80% (16/20)</small>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"smallInfoContainer\">\n            <b>Design</b>\n            <small>77% (10/13)</small>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"smallInfoContainer\">\n            <b>App Store</b>\n            <small>50% (2/4)</small>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"accessibility\">Accessibility</h3>\n<p>◎ Voice Over fully supported. <br />\n◎ Voice Control fully supported. <br />\n◎ Voice Over Gestures supported where needed (Magic tap, escape, etc.) <br />\n◎ <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors</code> where needed. <br />\n◉ Respects reduced motion and blurring where needed. <br />\n◉ Adaptive to all content sizes (i.e. dynamic type). <br />\n◉ Uses <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">readableContentGuide</code> for view that are predominantly text based. <br />\n◎ Color contrast is 7:1 or better. <br />\n◉ Supported smart color inversion elegantly. <br />\n◉ Bar button items supply a crisp landscape and large content size image. <br />\n◉ Glyphs have their <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">adjustsImageSizeForAccessibilityContentSizeCategory</code> set. <br />\n◉ Includes closed captions and audio descriptions, all images and icons have alternative text set. <br />\n◎ Leading and trailing margins are used for constraints to support left to right languages.  <br />\n◎ The User Interface appears flawlessly when tested using Double Length Pseudo-languages.  <br />\n◉ Using <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSShowNonLocalizedStrings</code> yields no results.  <br />\n◎ If you support drag and drop, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIAccessibilityLocationDescriptors</code> are all set.  <br />\n◎ Magic taps are supported for the app’s most common functionality.  <br />\n◉ It uses <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">CFBundleSpokenName</code> if the app’s name could potentially be mispronounced by the system (i..e CoolApp23 would be “CoolApp Twenty Three”).  <br />\n◎ Lastly, running the entire app through Accessibility Inspector produced no warnings and turning on Screen Curtain to navigate the app works flawlessly.  <br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Accessibility: 9/19 - 47%</strong></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"platform-technology\">Platform Technology</h3>\n<p>◉ Contextual interactions supported (Control previews, home shortcuts, quick actions and interaction delegate for unique experiences). <br />\n◎ Spotlight search and indexing support. <br />\n◉ Effective energy management (i.e. supports low power mode and reacts to it) <br />\n◎ Keyboard shortcuts have been added. The app could be used almost, or completely, with solely the use of a keyboard. <br />\n◎ It supports handoff on Mac (if applicable). <br />\n◎ Meaningful extensions are included with the app, whether it’s via a share extension, action extension, etc.<br />\n◎ Callback urls are supplied and documented so other apps may integrate with it (x-callback-url)/. <br />\n◎ Siri Intent support, when plausible: <br />\n◎ Siri Shortcuts also include intent phrases to help coach users <br />\n◎ Alternate app names are included when appropriate <br />\n◎ Watchface support <br />\n◎ If it makes sense, document sharing is supported via the file provider. <br />\n◉ Drag and drop has first class support: <br />\n    ◎ A fully fleshed out NSItemProvider exists for custom objects. <br />\n    ◉ Purposeful external and internal app drag support. <br />\n    ◉ This is used for reordering, should the app support it. <br />\n◎ If it makes sense, data can be shared via AirDrop. <br />\n◉ All tab bar images are vector .pdf images or have each corresponding size included to ensure they adapt correctly and are vended to accessibility modals properly. <br />\n◎ Any displayed Live Photo will animate when force touched and utilize PHLivePhotoImageView for playback. <br />\n    ◎ Each image also shows their system badge if available (i.e. live photo badges). <br />\n◉ Supports printing via <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIPrintInteractionController</code>. <br />\n◎ Has Siri Shortcuts supported or donated. <br />\n    ◎ Rich Siri Shortcuts support with parameters.\n◎ Running the Analyze function in Xcode yields no errors, warnings or suggestions. <br />\n◉ There are no calls to<code class=\"highlighter-rouge\"> UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions</code>, and <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIGraphicsImageRenderer</code> is used instead. <br />\n◎ Universal Links are supported, especially if your app’s content is available online. <br />\n◉ Modern multitasking is supported (slide over, split view and PiP). <br />\n◉ Multiple windows is supported on iPadOS. <br />\n◉ If it can be dragged, it can make a new window. <br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Platform Technology: 11/28 - 39%</strong></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"user-experience\">User Experience</h3>\n<p>◉ Supports native “undo” and “redo” actions, typically from shaking or from the iOS 13 gestures. <br />\n◉ The content type of all text views and text fields is included, and the correct keyboard type is used for the current context. \n◉ The keyboard’s language identifier is integrated correctly. <br />\n◎  Handles the keyboard being undocked on the iPad, if views are constrained to it via an inputAccessoryView. <br />\n◉ It’s localized and internationalized for all territories it’s released in. <br />\n◉ Text tends to not truncate and it never clips but rather it’s always readable. <br />\n◉ All tappable interface elements are at least 44 by 44 points. <br />\n◉ The entire app binary is under 30 megabytes. (No source here, this is based off a multitude of data points.) <br />\n◉ Delete actions always are followed by a confirmation prompt. <br />\n◎ If your app stores rich information files like a Keynote presentation, it uses the Quick Look API to preview it. <br />\n◎ State restoration is implemented via <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSUserActivity</code> APIs for scenes. <br />\n◉ It uses the correct audio settings, if audio can be played at all within it. <br />\n◉ Custom edit options are supported when text or an image is selected, if appropriate. <br />\n◉ The user is provided ample time to form an opinion about your app before you request a rating for it. <br />\n◉ The launch screen is branding free and closely resembles the first screen of the app. <br />\n◎ Before opening a link that could lead to another app in a web view or <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">SFSafariViewController</code>, try calling <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIApplication’s openURL:</code> with the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIApplicationOpenURLOptionUniversalLinksOnlyoption</code> first. <br />\n◉ Table views deselect selected rows in <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">viewDidAppear</code> when popping back to them.<br />\n◎ <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UITextInputAssistantItem</code> items are used to support common tasks on iPad that are at home within the shortcuts bar. <br />\n◉ When performing CRUD operations on a table or collection view, you opt to use <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">performBatchUpdates:</code><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\"> instead of </code>reloadData`. <br />\n◉ Testing for leaks and freed memory is part of your workflow, as consuming an unnecessary amount of memory and power hampers everyone. <br />\n◉ Navigation is clear and foolproof: \n    - Modality is used sparingly, and clearly brings them back to where they were when dismissed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>User Experience: 16/20 - 74%</strong></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"design\">Design</h3>\n<p>◉ Correct system margins are used throughout the app, and no hard coded ones are used (i.e. layoutMarginsGuide, safeAreaLayoutGuide, etc.)  <br />\n◉ Haptic feedback is used throughout the system to complement user interactions, and they are not overdone.  <br />\n◉ Controller transitions feel natural and fluid. Great examples are Calendar and Photos.  <br />\n◉ You opt for vector assets to combat the differing resolutions and avoid any blurry assets.  <br />\n◉ Your content is always the focus, and you constantly challenge if that’s true throughout the development cycles.  <br />\n◉ No segment controls are used in toolbars.  <br />\n◉ There are no toolbars and tab bars in the same screen.  <br />\n◉ Destructive actions are the last choice in action sheets.  <br />\n◉ Alerts, if used, ideally have to two choices and titles have no punctuation.  <br />\n◎ Alerts avoid using Yes and No as choices.  <br />\n◉ Switches are exclusively used within a table row.  <br />\n◎ You aspire to ship on all of Apple’s platforms (iOS iPhone + iPad, watchOS, tvOS and macOS).  <br />\n◎ Lastly, your app is “jank” free. You know what this means for you.  <br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Design: 10/13 - 77%</strong></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"app-store-presence\">App Store Presence</h3>\n<p>◎ An App Store preview video is used. <br />\n◎ Its keywords and category were carefully researched. <br />\n◉ The app icon follows the golden grid. <br />\n◉ The icon follows your brand’s primary color as well. <br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>App Store Presence: 2/4 - 50%</strong></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>No app is perfect, and no app can check off all of the boxes you want. But it’s motivating to have a goal to shoot for, and this list is mine. When it’s all done, I’ll feel extremely proud to have my name behind Spend Stack.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s to creating quality software, and this list being completely checked off sooner rather than later!</p>\n\n<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>",

Over on mobile, we’ve longed for such a minor roadblock to be the only thing in our path to refreshing our U.I. The pain was staggering - change one constraint in your layout code and then:</p>\n\n<p>1) Build <br />\n2) Run <br />\n3) Xcode says that your device is locked (it’s probably not) <br />\n4) Clean the project <br />\n5) You change the constant of the layout anchor, and Source Kit crashes <br />\n6) Throw your mac out the window <br />\n7) Pick your mac back up, apologize to it and start back at 1 <br /></p>\n\n<p>Look, you know where I’m going with this. If you’ve adopted SwiftUI (or even if you haven’t - view controllers apply here too) then you know Xcode Previews are more than a time saver. They are a fork in the road. There’s no going back once you get hooked on that instant feedback.</p>\n\n<p>Today, I’ll share a few quick snips of my go-to previews. Some of these are already well known, tweeted and blogged about - but my topic for this post is <em>my favorite</em> things to use with <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">PreviewProvider</code>, so I’ve included them anyways for posterity’s sake. Let’s take a look.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previewlayout\">PreviewLayout</h3>\n<p><b>What does it do?</b> Force a size on the given container.<br />\n<b>What’s it good for?</b> Making your preview mimic a certain size that’s realistic for your view, such as in a List scenario (i.e. cells in <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIKit</code> parlance). <br /></p>\n\n<p>For example, suppose we were crafting a cell type of <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">View</code> for our app. SwiftUI will post it up on the selected device by default (a sensible choice for the majority of development) but we can leverage <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">PreviewLayout</code> to put it into a more reasonable canvas size. Notice the left versus right:</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/pl1.jpg\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/pl1.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Further, one can impose a fixed size in addition to <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">.sizeThatFits</code>, or just take the device. But since Xcode Previews is drunk with power, why not show them all?</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">struct</span> <span class=\"kt\">ContentView_Previews</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">PreviewProvider</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">static</span> <span class=\"k\">var</span> <span class=\"nv\">previews</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kd\">some</span> <span class=\"kt\">View</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"kt\">Group</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"kt\">ContentView</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n                <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">previewLayout</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">sizeThatFits</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n                <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">previewDisplayName</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\".sizeThatFits\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n            <span class=\"kt\">ContentView</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n                <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">previewLayout</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">fixed</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">width</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">320</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">height</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">44</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n                <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">previewDisplayName</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\".fixed(width: 320, height: 44)\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n            <span class=\"kt\">ContentView</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n                <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">previewLayout</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">device</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n                <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">previewDisplayName</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\".device\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p><img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/pl2.png\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/pl2.png\" /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">Group</code> here? <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">PreviewLayout</code> doesn’t conform to <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">CaseIterable</code> currently, which, as we’ll see, lends itself perfectly to <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">ForEach</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Next, let’s hit on some pertinent environment values to preview against.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"contentsizecategory\">ContentSizeCategory</h3>\n<p><b>What does it do?</b> Specifies a content size for the preview, which drives the system’s font sizes among other things. <br />\n<b>What’s it good for?</b> Ensuring your app shines with dynamic type settings. <br /></p>\n\n<p>Dynamic type, at this point, shouldn’t be a “nice to have” - I truly feel it’s a “need to have”.

But, most aren’t. So it is in 2020, some of us forgot to constrain labels to their leading and trailing edges instead of their right or left sides.</p>\n\n<p>Being able to inject environment variables can claim back a mountain of previously lost productivity. This truly is a feedback loop that heretofore took one to many build and runs. So, in the name of Xcode, why not inject whatever outlandish requirement that might come your way.</p>\n\n<p>Need to know if your app works in Sri Lanka, with dark mode on and accessibility bold text enabled? In the stone age we’d take a few trip to Settings.app but in our new age of enlightenment it’s just a few quick lines of code:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">struct</span> <span class=\"kt\">ContentView_Previews</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">PreviewProvider</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">static</span> <span class=\"k\">var</span> <span class=\"nv\">previews</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kd\">some</span> <span class=\"kt\">View</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"kt\">ContentView</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n        <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">previewLayout</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">sizeThatFits</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">environment</span><span class=\"p\">(\\</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">locale</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kt\">Locale</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">identifier</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"si_LK\"</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n        <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">environment</span><span class=\"p\">(\\</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">legibilityWeight</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">bold</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">environment</span><span class=\"p\">(\\</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">colorScheme</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">dark</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some accessibility traits can’t be overriden within previews as far as I know.

Separations of concerns, easier unit testing and in our case, an easy way to mock real data.

The perfect cure for those late night spurts of creativity which used to require a trip to your mac.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>If Xcode Previews were a car, it would be a Tesla Roadster. Blazingly efficient, fast and once you experience it you don’t want anything else. I mean, this the <em>the car</em>. But like any vehicle or tool, you learn the ins. You learn the outs. The quirks, the hacks.</p>\n\n<p>And Xcode Previews has all of those things.</p>\n\n<p>But the time investment is minuscule in comparison to the time you save. We can lament about how they fail to refresh every now and then, toss up a painfully ambiguous error or what have you but remember - almost all of those things take less time to fix than it does for more most mature projects to build. So, harness your favorite previewing workflows (or steal the ones I’ve mentioned) and profit.</p>\n\n<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>",

Now, at age 31, I feel like I’ve finally arrived at a point where I can actually reflect on my year and make changes to get things done that I want to accomplish.</p>\n\n<p>This is big as an indie dev, because without a system in place <a href=\"http://localhost:4000/Introducing-Spend-Stack\">Spend Stack</a> simply would not exist. Why? Because I have three kids under six, am married, have a full time job, an indie app, a blog and, well, my own hobbies. I used to think time was too short, or there simply wasn’t enough of it. However, with some tweaks, I truly believe there is enough time in the day to live the lives that we want if we have the right habits to support it.</p>\n\n<p>After many mistakes, I know that if my day doesn’t have structure produced by some recurring habits, it gets lost in life’s many responsibilities. Today, I’ll share the system I have in place, and the apps that help support it, that have helped me form good habits.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"forgetting-goals\">Forgetting Goals</h3>\n<p>Years ago, if someone had told me to forget setting goals in the name of productivity, I’d call them mad. But I’ve since changed my thinking on them. As evidenced by books such as <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Irresistible-Addictive-Technology-Business-Keeping/dp/1594206643\">Irresistible</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Make-Time-Focus-Matters-Every/dp/0525572422\">Make Time</a> and <a href=\"https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits\">Atomic Habits</a>, the problem I’ve found with goals is that you stay on the hamster wheel.</p>\n\n<p>Accomplish one, then another immediately follows.</p>\n\n<p>For me, I need a smooth, constant feeling of accomplishment, and goals give me peaks and valleys. I’ve certainly found I admire goals much more than I enjoy them, so I’ve taken their good aspects and tossed out the rest instead of following another hackneyed goal system I might come up with.</p>\n\n<p>These days, I’m all about forming a system in my life to become the person who would accomplish the goals I want to.</p>\n\n<p>👨🏻‍💻 Is shipping Spend Stack a goal? Then become an indie dev.<br />\n🏃🏻‍♂️ Is getting in shape a goal? Then become athletic.<br />\n📖 Is delivering conference talks a goal? Become a speaker.<br /></p>\n\n<p>And so on.</p>\n\n<p>But in 2020, talk is still cheap. I need concrete methods to carry out a plan because hearing it and doing it are two different things. To that end, I’ve found that if I discover who I want to be and what major themes I want to accomplish - I can then formulate smaller goals from that information.</p>\n\n<p>At that point, I mostly disregard them and come up with a system to help me become the person who would be likely to routinely do those things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The TL;DR - For me it’s less about setting goals, and more about working backward from those goals to become the kind of person who would do those things by getting “1%” better as often as I can.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here’s how it works for me.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-journal-aspect\">The Journal Aspect</h3>\n<p>The first step is laying the foundation. Who am I, what am I about? What’s important to me, and what do I want to be known for? To help answer those kinds of things, I have an evergreen journal entry in Day One that I read each morning to set my frame of reference:</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/dayone.png\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/dayone.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>The information in the rest of that entry simply states things I’d like to do at a more finite level. The key is that I may or may not do some of these things, as I’ve written a generous amount of tasks down. So, the idea here is that having them front and center will help me remember the person I’m trying to be. This way, I avoid only thinking in terms of arbitrary boxes I’m trying to tick off in 2020 which would only lead to yet another set of boxes to check off.</p>\n\n<p>To get to this quickly, I’ve set up a trivial Shortcut that opens its respective URL:</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/dayoneURL.jpeg\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/dayoneURL.jpeg\" /></p>\n\n<p>If I read a simple document written by myself to give me that North Star (a concept I’ve talked a lot <a href=\"http://localhost:4000/Can-You-Learn-Design\">about</a>) for my life, I feel centered and my mind is a bit less cluttered.</p>\n\n<p>Once I’ve read the “big idea” though, it’s time to shift my focus to the day to day things.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"foundational-habits\">Foundational Habits</h3>\n<p>Things I need to do every single day are what I call foundational habits. This is the part where it becomes easy to make things far too ambiguous, so I’ve sectioned off foundational habits on an app by app basis, each one representing different domains of my life.</p>\n\n<p>Streaks is what I use to remind myself to do certain things each day of my life. I even order them in the same way I typically go about my day:</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/streaksFH.png\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/streaksFH.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>There’s a reason this has snagged one of the coveted Apple Design Awards - it’s simple to use, engaging and does one thing well. So I lean into it and try not to make it anything other than what it’s trying to do. An app that helps me do six things daily.</p>\n\n<p>So, ask yourself, based on the “big ideas” you have for your life - what things should you be doing, or want to do, daily?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"highlight-tasks\">Highlight Tasks</h3>\n<p>However, daily tasks are stringent by nature. We all have those moon shot goals in mind. Or, we simply have a bigger highlight (a term coined by the aforementioned Make Time book) that we want to tackle over one or more days.</p>\n\n<p>For this, I turn to Things 3. Here are some examples of things I’ve recently put in Things (zing!):</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/things.png\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/things.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>Clean out the entry closet, take items to Good Will or shoot hoops with my son - these are all great things that support who I want to be but aren’t likely to repetitive daily items. So, that kind of item goes here.</p>\n\n<p>With daily tasks and highlights accounted for, we now get into the menial tasks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"familylifehusbanddadindie-tasks\">Family/Life/Husband/Dad/Indie Tasks</h3>\n<p>Life has so many responsibilities, and for the “remember to take out the trash” or “pay my personal property tax by December 31st” kind of things I use Reminders. The key here is that these kinds of entries are either family-related or just plain “adulting” tasks:</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"lozad rounded center-img\" data-src=\"../assets/images/reminders.png\" role=\"presentation\" srcset=\"../assets/images/reminders.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>Since its iOS 13 overhaul, I’ve found Reminders to be even more component. I’ve always been a fan, but with its new features (such as grouped tasks) I’ve been able to lean on it even more.</p>\n\n<p>Further, this is the <em>only</em> tool I use for side project or Spend Stack action items.</p>\n\n<p>Why?</p>\n\n<p>Because it’s beautifully limiting. With so much happening in life, I found that if I opened up super tools (such as Github Issues, Asana or something similar) I would write a novel and likely not ever return to read it again. But Reminders is short and unforgivably terse.</p>\n\n<p>This is a perfect set of restrictions for me, and I’d imagine it’s the same reason a lot of creative folks produce breakthroughs under a certain level of rigidity or constraints. It forces only important ideas out. For the higher-level stuff, I use Notion. For the Do X and Y stuff, I use Reminders and love it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"app-recap\">App Recap</h3>\n<p>For reference, here’s a recap of the apps I’ve mentioned:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://dayoneapp.com\">Day One</a>: Journaling and “big picture” stuff.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://streaksapp.com\">Streaks</a>: Foundational, every single day things.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things 3</a>: “Highlight”-esque tasks.</li>\n  <li>Reminders in iOS: Family, adulting or Spend Stack centric tasks.</li>\n  <li>Shortcuts: To quickly open Day One entries.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.notion.so\">Notion</a>: For big picture ideas and documents related to Spend Stack.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Depending on your personality type, my system may sound like the most stressful thing since taking the ACT. That’s ok, my wife fits into this category. She’s a more of a “go with the flow” gal, and she balances me out in many ways.</p>\n\n<p>But, if you’re laughably Type-A like yours truly, having everything in its place and place for everything is simply invigorating and habit forming. While this may appear on the surface as too many tools to use - they each are serving a simple purpose. And that removes any ambiguity from my head, which helps me form the habits I want to.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>Over the years, I’ve discovered one truth when it comes to habits and the likelihood that I’ll achieve them - it’s about the 1% wins. As James Clear noted, the same way that investing in your 20s leads to riches through the magic of compound interest, so to do 1% habits in your day to day lead to compounded results over time.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, that’s all my little system does. 1% wins help me learn from the past, produce in the present and prepare for the future. If my goal is to write a book, I don’t write that down as the thing I want to do. Instead, I need to figure out what to do to become a writer. May you have an amazing 2020 in accomplishing all of your aspirations, and heres to better habits 🍻!</p>\n\n<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>",
